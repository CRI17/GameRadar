    <p>WINDJAMMERS 2 REVIEW
    To frisbee, or not to frisbee?

    Did you know 'windjammer' was a slang term for a sailing ship once upon a time? I can see some sense in that name, but I could not have guessed from the name alone that Windjammers was also a '90s sports game about two opponents locked in an intense battle of competitive frisbeeâ€”essentially Pong with special abilities.
    
    Is this a real sport? Not really, but a quick search showed me there is Ultimate Frisbee, which has teams and is played on a big pitch? I've learned so much from Windjammers 2, a delightful arcade game I only wish was better at teaching me about itself. 
    
    The fundamentals of Windjammers and Windjammers 2 are more or less the same. Not just in controls and design, but in the throwback vibe of their aesthetics, too. The new slick, hand drawn-looking sprites capture those same bold colours to convey an idealized, feel-good 1990s where the sun is always shining and we're all here to have a good time. Like the bits of old Power Rangers when they weren't fighting a rubber man from outer space and doing backflips. I'm not immune to this nostalgia, even if its sunny excess barely reflects any of my experiences during the actual '90s.</p>
