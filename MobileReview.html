<p>Super Mario Run Hits Android in March
Nintendo urged fans to register online for an official notification once the title becomes available.

Designed for one-handed play, the game is simple: Mario (or one of his many friends) automatically runs forward, while you make him hurdle enemies and collect coins by tapping. The longer you hold, the higher Mario jumps and the higher your score. The ultimate goal is to reach the flagpole at the end of the course before time runs out.

Three gameplay elements include the traditional World Tour (rescue Princess Peach from Bowser's clutches!), Kingdom Builder (create a unique kingdom), and Toad Rally (compete against other players).

Nintendo's second mobile title was released in December for nostalgic iOS players, who can choose to download the modified game for free, or make a one-time purchase of $9.99 for unlimited access. Details about the Android variation are scant; Nintendo did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment.

And while Super Mario Run landed on iOS first, Android users will be the first to check out the new Fire Emblem title next month, according to TechCrunch.</p>
